The maladaptive self-state appears to be more rigid and dominant, with a negative Affect driving the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, hindering their psychological needs, whereas the adaptive self-state is less clear and less dominant, with a positive Desire/Need influencing the individual's thoughts and feelings, supporting their psychological needs.  The individual's self-states show a pattern of maladaptive self-states being more dominant and rigid, with a negative Affect driving their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, hindering their psychological needs, while the adaptive self-state is less prominent and less clear, with a positive Desire/Need influencing their thoughts and feelings, supporting their psychological needs.
