    "83997cd4e7":"The interplay between adaptive and maladaptive self-states in this timeline is not noticeable.  The adaptive self-states are often dominating the narrative, driven by positive Affect, while maladaptive self-states are less prominent. The individual seeks external validation and a sense of belonging, and in rare occasions remain stuck in maladaptive self-states, characterized by negative emotions, behaviors, and thoughts that hinder the fulfillment of basic psychological needs.",
    "46f4bb3ada":"This timeline is occasionally characterized by maladaptive self-states, where some negative emotions, thoughts, and behaviors have hindered their psychological needs, particularly relatedness, autonomy, and competence, with a central organizing aspect of Desire/Need for escape or avoidance. However, the adaptive self-state is generally more dominant., marked by positive affect. The individual is attuned to her own needs.",
    "0cac13e357":"The individual's self-states have not fluctuated over time. Maladaptive self-states are dominant, characterized by negative Affect, maladaptive Behavior, and maladaptive Cognition, hindering the fulfillment of basic desires/needs such as relatedness and autonomy. The adaptive self-states tend to be overshadowed by the maladaptive self-states, which are often triggered by specific situations or emotions, highlighting the need for ongoing self-reflection and therapeutic intervention to address these negative patterns.",
    "5da839acb5":"This timeline began with prominent adaptive self-states. Subsequent posts were then solely characterized by a maladaptive pattern of negative emotions, behaviors, and thoughts that hinder the fulfillment of basic psychological needs, with a dominant central organizing aspect of Affect driving the maladaptive self-states, influencing the other aspects, and leading to maladaptive behaviors and cognitions, with a notable lack of adaptive self-states and a persistent nature of the maladaptive self-states over time. The adaptive voice then grew stronger towards the end of the timeline, strongly influenced by the idealization of the ex partner.",
    "6c9677b482":"The individualâ€™s self-states are very consistent. In particular, the timeline is dominated by maladaptive voices, overwhelming their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, fear, and anxiety. The maladaptive self-states are driven by intense negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and self-disgust, which influence the individual's behavior and cognition, hindering the fulfillment of basic psychological needs like autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In contrast, the adaptive self-states are driven by positive emotions, such as a desire for connection and relatedness, which support the individual's psychological needs and promote healthy behaviors and thoughts. Adaptive self states are not noticeable in this timeline, and they remain having negative cognitions of others in the face of social situations."
