                    "- While the **Inland Revenue (IR 12)** allowed schemes to use alternative indices, the **specific wording of Rule 53** did not mirror this flexibility, meaning the trustees\u2019 power was **limited**.",

                    "#### **Conclusion**  \nThe Supreme Court **dismissed the appeal**, confirming that:  \n- The **trustees cannot unilaterally replace the RPI** unless it is **officially discontinued**.",

                    "The dispute centers on whether these items qualify as \"buildings\" under the *Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990* (the *Listed Buildings Act*), and whether their listing status can be challenged in enforcement proceedings.",
                    "#### **Background**\nThe urns originally stood at Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, before being moved multiple times by their owners, eventually ending up at Idlicote House in Warwickshire.",
                    "In 1986, they were listed under the *Town and Country Planning Act 1971*, but the owner, Marcus Dill, was unaware of their listed status.",

                    "However, the Transfer Order was modeled on **section 265 of the Highways Act 1980**, which governs **transfers between highway authorities** (e.g., when a road becomes a trunk road).",
                    "Unlike section 263, section 265 was designed for **clean transfers of all relevant property** between public bodies, not just the \"zone of ordinary use.\"",

                    "The **Baird principle does not apply** to transfers between highway authorities under section 265 or the Transfer Order, as these provisions serve a different purpose (succession of ownership) rather than initial vesting.",
                    "The Court rejected the Councils' argument that \"highway\" must always mean the \"zone of ordinary use,\" noting that:  \n- **Section 265 and Article 2(1)(a) were intended for complete transfers** between authorities, not limited vesting.",

                    "#### **Additional Considerations**  \n- **Section 266A (later provision for GLA road transfers)** was discussed but deemed irrelevant to interpreting Article 2.",

                    "- **Lateral plane issues** (side boundaries) were not addressed, as the case focused on vertical ownership.",
                    "#### **Conclusion**  \nThe Supreme Court **allowed TfL\u2019s appeal**, ruling that:  \n- **Article 2(1)(a) transfers all property vested in the Councils as highway authority**, not just the \"zone of ordinary use.\"",

                    "- Exclusion would create **windfall benefits for guilty defendants** and hinder justice.",
