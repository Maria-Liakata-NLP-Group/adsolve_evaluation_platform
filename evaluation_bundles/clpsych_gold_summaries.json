    "83997cd4e7": "In this timeline, there appears to be a fluctuation between an adaptive and a maladaptive self-state. In the last post, the fluctuation is noticeable, with the maladaptive self-state being reflected first, followed by an adaptive self-state where he perceives others as connected to him and behaves in a related way toward them. However, in the second post, this adaptive self-state is not evident.",
    "46f4bb3ada":"The dominant self-state is marked by an anxious and depressed affect, accompanied by avoidance and self-harm behaviors, with a perception of others as detached and not understanding her.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive self-state is a faint attempt to be attuned to her own needs, though it is close to engaging in avoidance behaviors as a way to temporarily feel better.",
    "0cac13e357":"The self-states in this timeline fluctuate between adaptive and maladaptive both within individual posts and across different posts. In some posts, both voices are present in varying intensities, while in others, such as the one mentioning her depression, the maladaptive voice is particularly dominant.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, she perceives herself and others as capable and believes in her ability to provide help and support. On the other hand, she sometimes views people as manipulative and exploitative, feeling taken advantage of.",
    "5da839acb5":"Throughout the timeline, the self states were mostly maladaptive, sometimes present by themselves with no adaptive counterparts. this very severe maladaptive dominance was mainly characterized by the expectation that the writer will hurt themselves, and that their relatedness needs will never be met. the two intertwined throughout the timeline. these were strongly influenced by the presence of idealization of the ex boyfriend. that being said, the adaptive cognition of her best friend as someone she loves, allowed her through most of the timeline to postpone her suicide plans. this adaptive voice grew weaker by the end of the timeline.",
    "6c9677b482": "although the presence of the maladaptive self states in the post changed quite a bit, the presence of the adaptive voices was always medium-high. it seems that when the writer dares to get out and deal with her social anxiety, although she sometimes faces difficulties, it is  also a rewarding experience that boosts the presence of the adaptive self state and ignites other elements of the adaptive self state, such as having more positive cognitions of others."
