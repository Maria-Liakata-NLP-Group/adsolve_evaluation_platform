It\u2019s hard to talk to people about the mess of emotions I feel, or the jumbled thoughts I have. I know people care about me, at least some of the time, but not enough for me to feel okay with talking about the things that keep me up at night. It\u2019s a really lonely, isolating feeling to have. But god, I wish anyone cared more than the bare minimum. Enough to reach inside my chest and rip the hurt right from the comfortable place it rests, covered up by all the excuses and lies I use just to make it through each day.  There\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened this year, so much I\u2019ve let people get away with because my heart is just a little too big for blame and anger to hold onto.

Even still, I feel like I'm not where I'm meant to be at all and it's slowly killing me. So many people I know are getting their shit together - getting in happy relationships and starting families, having their own homes, and living their best lives. And I know I shouldn't be so worried about that stuff at 23, but fuck. I've been dealt shitty cards from the start and I'm sick of not having anything good for myself. I'm sick of feeling like a shadow in this world.  On top of that, I'm getting increasingly lonely, and usually I can control this feeling and not let it get to me but we all know the role depression plays in making you feel isolated. It's so hard to make friends though. Every time I open up to  someone, or try to build a connection with them, in the end I'm not good enough and they leave.

When I do, people assume I am something that I hate.\nSo, for some backstory - I've had depression, avoidance and anxiety for about 12 years now. It completely ruined my life; I dropped out of education, I'm unable to work, I have 0 friends in real life and human interaction terrifies or even disgusts me. Being in a crowded place could make me cry. I would stay in my flat for months, just getting groceries every now and then, rarely ever cleaning up after myself and sinking into the internet for distraction, so I wouldn't have to feel anything.   The last year has been the first that I actually felt like I'm getting better. I'm being treated medically and with therapy, I am no longer completely lonely and I have been making efforts to do things, even ones I don't like. I have been leaving the house.   However, I moved. I got into a really bad place for the first few months and shelled in again, but now I got used to my new temporary home and environment. However, going out is much, much harder.  I'm in Israel right now, so I stand out a bit as a pale, tall northern european girl. People stare at me. There have been cases when they actually made remarks about how pale I am, that I look like a freak and a snob. But that's not the worst part.  Whenever I go to a new restaurant or other place where you are catered to by other people, they assume that I'm russian. Now, that might not seem like a big deal, as they don't mean any harm - they see an european looking person and assume that. But it fills me with burning anger and self-disgust.  Russians have killed, raped and mentally scarred people from my country for decades. Several members of my family were killed by them. The same applies to many other european countries and this amount of ignorance is appalling. Our ancestors, language and alphabet, religion and folklore are completely different. I have no russians in my bloodline. There is literally no connection between us other than war, blood and perhaps commerce. Unless you hear a person speaking russian, you shouldn't assume they are and I hate that it's happening to me.   Today, I asked for an English menu. I was instantly asked \"Russian?\" \"no...english\" \"oh, I just assumed, because you know...*waves towards my face*\" in that moment I felt so ashamed, dirty and angry. I wanted to smash my face until it was something else. I wanted to burrow myself into the ground. I wanted to blurt out \"I wonder how you would feel if everyone assumed you were palestinian\" but I just kept quiet with my distilled anger and shame. It wasn't their fault and I shouldn't insult them.  I don't know how to deal with this. I hate this so much.
