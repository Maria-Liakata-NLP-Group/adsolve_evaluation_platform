The case highlights the complexities and challenges faced by the police in balancing the need to maintain public order with the rights of individuals to protest.

It emphasizes the principle of deference to the trial judge's findings, especially in cases where the trial judge has had the opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses and the evidence presented. This principle is crucial in ensuring that appellate courts do not unduly interfere with the decisions made by trial judges, who are in a better position to evaluate the evidence and make factual determinations.\n",

The case illustrates the importance of a clear understanding of the law and the need for police to take a proactive approach in managing parades to prevent violence and ensure public safety. It also underscores the role of the Parades Commission in providing guidance and oversight in the management of parades, and the need for police to work closely with this body to ensure that parades are conducted in a lawful and orderly manner.\n",

The PSNI did not intervene until March 2013, despite the fact that the parades were not notified to the Parades Commission, which oversees public processions in Northern Ireland under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. The appellants argued that the police had misinterpreted their powers under the Act, leading to the unlawful stopping of the parade.\n",

The court held that the police had a duty to ensure that the parade was notified to the Parades Commission before it could take place. The court also emphasized the importance of balancing the right to peaceful assembly (article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights) with the need to maintain public order and protect the rights of others.\n",
