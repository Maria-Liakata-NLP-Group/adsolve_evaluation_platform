Background:
The flags protests in Northern Ireland were a series of demonstrations that began in December 2012 and continued until March 2013. The protests were primarily organized by loyalists and took place in Belfast, particularly in the Short Strand area, which is predominantly nationalist. The protests were sparked by the decision of the City Council to limit the flying of the Union flag over Belfast City Hall to certain designated days only.

Explanation:
The Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 was introduced to regulate public processions and parades in Northern Ireland. Under this Act, the Parades Commission was established to oversee the notification and regulation of public processions. The Act also provided for the possibility of a prohibition order by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.

The flags protests were not notified to the Parades Commission, and therefore, under the Act, the protesters were committing an offence by not notifying the police of their intentions. The police, however, were not specifically empowered to ban a parade under the Act. Instead, they had to rely on their general public order policing powers, which include the duty to protect life and property, preserve order, prevent the commission of offences, and bring offenders to justice.

The police strategy to deal with the flags protests was called Operation Dulcet. The police developed a plan to enforce conditions imposed by the Parades Commission or a prohibition order by the Secretary of State. In the absence of such determinations, the police had to rely on their general public order powers.

The police considered that there was a need to try and facilitate some form of protest at Belfast City Hall to allow for some venting of anger and relief of community tension. As a result, the police decided to allow the protests to continue, albeit with lower numbers.

The police also took into account human rights considerations, including the right to life, private life, and assembly. They aimed to balance these competing rights while maintaining public order and preventing the commission of offences.

In February 2013, the police changed their policy regarding the flags protests. They decided to stop the unnotified parade, taking into account the views of the nationalist community, the wider attitude of the Protestant/Unionist/Loyalist community, and the likely reaction from Loyalists.

 Summary:

The case revolves around the actions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in relation to the weekly parades in Short Strand, Belfast, which were organized by loyalist groups. The parades were deemed illegal as they were not notified to the Parades Commission, a regulatory body established under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. The PSNI, under the leadership of Assistant Chief Constable Kerr, did not take any action to stop the parades, despite the potential risk to public safety.

The PSNI's decision not to intervene was based on the belief that they did not have the power to stop the parades under the 1998 Act. However, the judge in the case found that the police had the power to prevent the parades from taking place, as they were considered illegal due to the lack of notification. The judge also found that the PSNI had failed to uphold their obligations under section 32 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, which requires the police to prevent the commission of crime.

The judge concluded that the PSNI's failure to act had undermined the 1998 Act and violated the appellants' rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The judge also found that the PSNI had failed to discharge its positive obligation to protect the appellants from unjustified interference with their rights.

In summary, the case highlights the importance of the police's role in upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of individuals. The PSNI's failure to act in this case resulted in a violation of the appellants' rights and undermined the 1998 Act. The case serves as a reminder of the need for clear and effective legislation to regulate public processions and the importance of police accountability in enforcing the law.

 Summary:

The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Treacy J to dismiss the appeal by ACC Kerr, the then Assistant Chief Constable of the PSNI, against his decision not to stop the unnotified parades in Northern Ireland. The Court of Appeal found that the decision to not stop the parades was not in breach of the 1998 Act, which requires the police to prevent parades that may cause serious disorder. The Court of Appeal also found that the steps taken by the police to protect the rights of residents in Short Strand were proportionate. The North report, which recommended the establishment of an independent body to decide whether parades should take place and under what conditions, was not implemented in its entirety in the 1998 Act. The Act established the Parades Commission, which has the power to impose conditions on public processions, but only after receiving a notification from the person proposing to organise the parade. The Act also gives the Secretary of State the power to review or revoke a determination by the Parades Commission and to ban parades in certain circumstances.

 Summary:

The document discusses the legal framework and police powers in Northern Ireland regarding the control of parades, particularly those that are not notified to the Parades Commission. It references the 1998 Act, which was designed to address the issue of contentious parades and the role of the police in managing them. The document clarifies that the police do not have a duty to facilitate parades but have the power to stop them if they are not notified, to prevent disorder or crime. It also touches on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), specifically articles 8 and 11, which protect the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of assembly, respectively. The document argues that the police's response to unnotified parades is not a derogation from these rights but a necessary measure to maintain public order and protect the rights of others. It concludes that the 1998 Act has not been undermined and that the police's actions are based on the need to prevent violence and disorder.

Issue:
The central issue was whether the police had a proper understanding of their powers under the 1998 Act and whether their actions were proportionate in light of their obligation to protect the appellant's article 8 rights.

The protests were particularly intense in the Short Strand area, where the appellant lived. The PSNI was tasked with managing the protests and ensuring public order.

The appellant argued that the police failed to protect her article 8 rights, which include the right to respect for her private and family life, home, and correspondence. She claimed that the police had misconstrued their powers under the 1998 Act and that their actions were disproportionate.

The Court of Appeal found that the police had misconstrued their powers and that their actions were disproportionate. The appellant appealed this decision, arguing that the court had not properly considered the issue of proportionality and that the police had not fully understood their powers under the 1998 Act.
