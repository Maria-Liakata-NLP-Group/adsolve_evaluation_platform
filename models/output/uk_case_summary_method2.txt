Background to the Appeal

The case in question involves the actions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) during a series of flags protests in Belfast, particularly in the Short Strand area.  The appellant, Ms.  Quinlivan, contended that the police failed to protect her article 8 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and that the police had misinterpreted their powers under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  The flags protests were organized by the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, and took place in December and January.  The appellant resided in the Short Strand area, which was the epicenter of the protests.  The PSNI was responsible for managing the protests and ensuring public order. 

Judgement

The Court of Appeal found that the police had misconstrued their powers and that their actions were disproportionate.  The appellant appealed this decision, arguing that the court had not properly considered the issue of proportionality and that the police had not fully understood their powers under the 1998 Act.  The appellate court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and made a declaration that the PSNI had misconstrued their legal powers to stop parades passing through or adjacent to the Short Strand area.  The court found that the police had not properly understood their powers under the 1998 Act and that their actions were disproportionate.
