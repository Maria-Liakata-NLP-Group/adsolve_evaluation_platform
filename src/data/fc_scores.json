            "The individual's self-states are characterized by a mix of maladaptive and adaptive states, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, fear, and anxiety, while adaptive states emerge in situations of connection and support, highlighting the interplay between these states and the importance of flexibility in coping with challenging situations.",
            "The maladaptive self-states are driven by intense negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and self-disgust, which influence the individual's behavior and cognition, hindering the fulfillment of basic psychological needs like autonomy, competence, and relatedness.",
            "In contrast, the adaptive self-states are driven by positive emotions, such as a desire for connection and relatedness, which support the individual's psychological needs and promote healthy behaviors and thoughts.",
            "The individual's self-states are in a state of tension, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, but adaptive states providing a sense of purpose and connection in situations of support and connection.",
            "The individual's maladaptive self-states are characterized by a sense of rigidity, as they are driven by intense negative emotions and a lack of flexibility in coping with challenging situations, while their adaptive self-states are marked by a sense of improvement, as they emerge in situations of connection and support.",
            "The individual's self-states are also marked by a sense of deterioration, as their maladaptive self-states can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, but also by a sense of improvement, as their adaptive self-states can provide a sense of purpose and connection.",
            "The individual's maladaptive self-states are also characterized by a lack of self-awareness, as they are driven by intense negative emotions and a lack of understanding of their own thoughts and behaviors, while their adaptive self-states are marked by a sense of self-awareness, as they are driven by a desire for connection and relatedness.",
            "The individual's self-states are also marked by a sense of temporal dynamics, as their maladaptive self-states can be overcome with the help of supportive comments from others, and their adaptive self-states can emerge in situations of connection and support.",
            "Overall, the individual's self-states are in a state of flux, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, but adaptive states providing a sense of purpose and connection in situations of support and connection.",
            "The individual's maladaptive self-states are also characterized by a sense of rigidity, as they are driven by intense negative emotions"
