However, in the second post, this adaptive self-state is not evident.",
                "46f4bb3ada": "The dominant self-state is marked by an anxious and depressed affect, accompanied by avoidance and self-harm behaviors, with a perception of others as detached and not understanding her.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive self-state is a faint attempt to be attuned to her own needs, though it is close to engaging in avoidance behaviors as a way to temporarily feel better.",

On the other hand, she sometimes views people as manipulative and exploitative, feeling taken advantage of.",

                "6c9677b482": "although the presence of the maladaptive self states in the post changed quite a bit, the presence of the adaptive voices was always medium-high. it seems that when the writer dares to get out and deal with her social anxiety, although she sometimes faces difficulties, it is  also a rewarding experience that boosts the presence of the adaptive self state and ignites other elements of the adaptive self state, such as having more positive cognitions of others."
