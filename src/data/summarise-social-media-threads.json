However, in the second post, this adaptive self-state is not evident.",

In some posts, both voices are present in varying intensities, while in others, such as the one mentioning her depression, the maladaptive voice is particularly dominant.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, she perceives herself and others as capable and believes in her ability to provide help and support. On the other hand, she sometimes views people as manipulative and exploitative, feeling taken advantage of.",
                "5da839acb5":"Throughout the timeline, the self states were mostly maladaptive, sometimes present by themselves with no adaptive counterparts. this very severe maladaptive dominance was mainly characterized by the expectation that the writer will hurt themselves, and that their relatedness needs will never be met. the two intertwined throughout the timeline. these were strongly influenced by the presence of idealization of the ex boyfriend. that being said, the adaptive cognition of her best friend as someone she loves, allowed her through most of the timeline to postpone her suicide plans. this adaptive voice grew weaker by the end of the timeline.",
                "6c9677b482": "although the presence of the maladaptive self states in the post changed quite a bit, the presence of the adaptive voices was always medium-high. it seems that when the writer dares to get out and deal with her social anxiety, although she sometimes faces difficulties, it is  also a rewarding experience that boosts the presence of the adaptive self state and ignites other elements of the adaptive self state, such as having more positive cognitions of others."

The maladaptive self-states have been persistent over time, with no clear indication of an adaptive self-state, and a notable lack of flexibility and rigidity in the individual's self-states, suggesting a need for further exploration and intervention to support the development of adaptive.",
                    "6c9677b482": "The individual's self-states are characterized by a mix of maladaptive and adaptive states, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, fear, and anxiety, while adaptive states emerge in situations of connection and support, highlighting the interplay between these states and the importance of flexibility in coping with challenging situations.  The maladaptive self-states are driven by intense negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and self-disgust, which influence the individual's behavior and cognition, hindering the fulfillment of basic psychological needs like autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In contrast, the adaptive self-states are driven by positive emotions, such as a desire for connection and relatedness, which support the individual's psychological needs and promote healthy behaviors and thoughts. The individual's self-states are in a state of tension, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, but adaptive states providing a sense of purpose and connection in situations of support and connection. The individual's maladaptive self-states are characterized by a sense of rigidity, as they are driven by intense negative emotions and a lack of flexibility in coping with challenging situations, while their adaptive self-states are marked by a sense of improvement, as they emerge in situations of connection and support. The individual's self-states are also marked by a sense of deterioration, as their maladaptive self-states can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, but also by a sense of improvement."
