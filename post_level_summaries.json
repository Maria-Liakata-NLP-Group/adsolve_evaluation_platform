    "The post describes a situation involving two individuals, a 20-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman, who engage in sexual activities, including oral sex, despite the woman having a boyfriend. The post highlights the conflicting perspectives on the situation, with a deontological view considering it morally wrong and a utilitarian view focusing on the perceived benefits. The individuals also mention experiencing depression and finding relief through these activities, and the woman's history of infidelity. The central organizing aspect appears to be Desire/Need, specifically the desire for sexual gratification and the need for emotional support. This desire/need influences the Affect (pleasure, relief), Behavior (sexual acts), and Cognition (rationalization of the actions) of both individuals. The post suggests that the individuals are experiencing both adaptive and maladaptive self-states. The adaptive self-state is characterized by the desire for sexual gratification and the need for emotional support, which is fulfilled through the sexual activities. The maladaptive self-state is characterized by the violation of the woman's relationship with her boyfriend, which is driven by the desire for sexual gratification and the need for emotional support. The post also highlights the potential for the individuals to experience negative emotions and behaviors due to the maladaptive self-state, such as guilt and shame.",
    "The post describes a maladaptive self-state related to the individual's past bullying experiences. The central organizing aspect is Cognition, specifically the intrusive and distressing memories of the bullying. This negative cognition triggers a strong Affective response (tears, inability to rest), which in turn influences Behavior (bursting into tears, seeking comfort from a friend). The individual's Desire/Need for safety and emotional regulation is being thwarted by the intrusive memories. The post also mentions a potential adaptive self-state related to the individual's new school environment, which provides a sense of security and support. However, the focus remains on the maladaptive self-state and its impact on the individual's ability to rest and cope.",
